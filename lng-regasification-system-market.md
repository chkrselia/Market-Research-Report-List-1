<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LNG Regasification System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OnLand</li><li>OnFloatingBarges</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LNG regasification system market comprises two main types: onshore and floating barges. Onshore regasification facilities are fixed installations at coastal terminals where liquefied natural gas is converted back to gas form for distribution. In contrast, floating regasification units (FSRUs) are mobile platforms moored offshore that can perform regasification while providing storage capabilities. Both systems aim to enhance LNG supply flexibility, improve energy security, and facilitate access to natural gas in regions lacking infrastructure.</p></p>
