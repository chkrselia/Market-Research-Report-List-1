<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Vacuum Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-sealed</li><li>Water-ring</li><li>DryVacuum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical vacuum boosters enhance the efficiency of vacuum systems by increasing pressure differentials. The oil-sealed type uses oil to create a seal and maintain vacuum levels, offering high performance but requiring regular maintenance. Water-ring boosters employ water as a sealing medium, providing effective cooling and lubrication while minimizing emissions, making them suitable for specific applications. Dry vacuum boosters, on the other hand, utilize no liquid seals, offering a cleaner operation ideal for environments sensitive to contamination, ensuring high reliability and efficiency.</p></p>
