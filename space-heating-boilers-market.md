<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Space Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The space heating boilers market primarily consists of non-condensing and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate at lower efficiency, exhausting hot gases without reusing heat, making them less energy-efficient. In contrast, condensing boilers utilize exhaust gases to preheat incoming water, achieving higher efficiency and lower emissions. This technology allows them to extract more heat from the fuel, resulting in reduced energy costs and environmental impact. The choice between these types often depends on efficiency requirements, installation costs, and long-term savings.</p></p>
